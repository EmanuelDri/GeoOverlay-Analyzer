# **App Name**: GeoOverlay Analyzer

## Core Features:

- Area Identifier: Leverage Google Maps and a vector analysis tool to identify CÃ³rdoba's barrios which fall within or outside a set of given image coordinates, along with polygon vertex generation. Use reasoning to determine which barrio a certain portion of a polygon overlaps using the area within each of the defined regions as a tool.
- Barrio Display: Displays a list of all of Cordoba's barrios.
- Overlap indicator: Shows, for each barrio, a designation of 'total overlap', 'partial overlap' or 'no overlap'.
- Percentage readout: Presents an overlap percentage for partially-overlapped barrios.
- Geospatial Overlay: Visual display of each partially-overlapped barrio, along with its overlapping polygon coordinates.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Moderate blue (#5DADE2) to communicate the informational character of the application.
- Background color: Very light blue (#EBF5FB), same hue as the primary color but heavily desaturated and bright, helps with readability.
- Accent color: Light green (#A3E4D7) to draw the eye to geospatial overlaps in the UI.
- Clean, sans-serif font for optimal readability of location data and analysis results.
- Location-based icons to represent barrios and geospatial features.
- Clear, sectioned layout for barrio list, overlap indicators, and percentage readouts.
